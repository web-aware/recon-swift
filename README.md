# Record Notation (RECON)

RECON brings attributes into the era of object notation, and provides a simple
grammar and uniform tree model for attributed text markup.  RECON aims to
combine the minimalism of JSON with the expressiveness of XML in a
human-friendly syntax.

## Language Quick Start

### Primtives

RECON has three primitive datatypes: _text_, _number_, and _data_.

#### Text

Text values take one of two forms: a quoted _string_, or an unquoted
_identifier_.

```recon
"string"
identifier
```

#### Numbers

Numbers serialize as decimal literals.

```recon
-1
3.14
6.02e23
```

#### Data

Binary data serializes as a leading '%' symbol, followed by a base64 literal.

```recon
%AA==
```

### Records

RECON's sole aggregate datatype, the _record_, plays the combined role of array
and associative array.  Think of a record as a partially keyed list.  The
example record below contains two ordered items, first a "subject" field with
value "Greetings", then the unkeyed string "Hello, Earthlings!".

```recon
{ subject: "Greetings", "Hello, Earthlings!" }
```

A single comma, a single semicolon, or one or more newlines separate items.
Newline separated records provide a clean syntax for pretty-printed documents.

```recon
{
  subject: "Re: Greetings"
  "Hi Martians!"
}
```

Records support arbitrary values as slot keys.

```recon
{
  @planet Jupiter: {}
  @god Jupiter: {}
}
```

### Blocks

Top-level documents can omit the curly braces around their root record.  We
call the content of a record, sans curly braces, a _block_.  When a block
contains only a single item, the value of the block reduces to just the value
of the item it contains.  The example block below is equivalent to the sample
record above.

```recon
subject: "Re: Greetings"
"Hi Martians!"
```

### Attributes

The @ sign introduces an attribute.  Attributes call out key fields of a
record.  The previous markup example further reduces to the form below.

```recon
{
  "Hello, "
  {
    "@em":
    "world"
  }
  "!"
}
```

Note that the `@em` field above has no explicit value.  The RECON data model
refers to unspecified–but existent–values as _extant_.  We say that the record
`@em[world]` has an extant attribute named `em`.

Of course, attributes can have associated values too.  Place attribute
parameters in parentheses, following the attribute's name.

```recon
@answer(42)
@event("onClick")
```

The above attributes are structurally equivalent to:

```recon
{"@answer":42}
{"@event":"onClick"}
```

Attribute parentheses enclose a block, meaning attribute values construct an
implicit record when needed. An example, with its desugared equivalent, follows.

```recon
@img(src: "tesseract.png", width: 10, height: 10, depth: 10, time: -1)

{
  "@img": {
    src: "tesseract.png"
    width: 10
    height: 10
    depth: 10
    time: -1
  }
}
```

Attributes _modify_ adjacent values.  Modified values interpolate into the
record formed by their adjacent attributes.  Here are some examples of values
with prefix, postfix, and circumfix attributes:

```recon
@duration 30
30 @seconds
@duration 30 @seconds
@relative @duration 30 @seconds
```

The above attribute expressions desugar to the following records:

```recon
{ "@duration":, 30 }
{ 30, "@seconds": }
{ "@duration":, 30, "@seconds": }
{ "@relative":, "@duration":, 30, "@seconds": }
```

Modified records flatten into the record formed by their adjacent attributes.
So `@point{x:0,y:0}`, reduces to `{"@point":,x:0,y:0}`, not
`{"@point":,{x:0,y:0}}`.

### Markup

Square brackets denote _markup_.  Markup offers an inverted syntax for records,
with values embedded in text, as opposed to text embedded in records.

```recon
[Hello, @em[world]!]
```

Markup is really just syntactic sugar for records.  The above example expresses
the exact same structure as the one below.

```recon
{ "Hello, "; @em "world"; "!" }
```

Curly braces within markup lift the enclosed block into the markup's record.
The following records are equivalent.

```recon
[Answer: {42}.]
{ "Answer", 42, "." }
```

Square brackets lift nested markup into the enclosing record.  Make sure to
backslash escape square brackets if you want to include them verbatim.

```recon
[Say [what]?]
{ "Say ", "what", "?"}

[Say \[what\]?]
{ "Say [what]?" }
```

Sequential attributes within markup don't chain; each markup-embedded
attribute inserts a nested record.

```recon
[http@colon@slash@slash]
{ "http", @colon, @slash, @slash }
```

Attributes in markup can prefix curly brace enclosed blocks, and nested markup.

```recon
[Goals: @select(max:2){fast,good,cheap}.]
{ "Goals: ", @select(max:2){fast,good,cheap}, "." }
```

Beware that whitespace inside markup is significant.  Notice how the single
space added to the example below completely changes its meaning, when compared
to the previous example.

```recon
[Goals: @select(max:2) {fast,good,cheap}.]
{ "Goals: ", @select(max:2), " ", {fast,good,cheap}, "." }
```

## Swift Library

To use the Swift REOCN library, import the `Recon` module.

```swift
import Recon
```

### Tutorial

Parse RECON strings using the `Value.parseRecon` factory method.

```swift
let event = Value.parseRecon("@event(onClick),@command()")!
```

Serialize RECON values using the `recon` method.

```swift
event.recon // returns "{@event(onClick),@command()}""
```

Use the `reconBlock` method to flatten any top-level records.

```swift
event.reconBlock // returns "@event(onClick),@command()""
```

Subscripts get indexed and keyed values.

```swift
let msg = Value.parseRecon("{from: me, to: you}")!
msg[0] // returns Attr("from", "me")
msg["to"] // returns Item("you")
```

### Data Model

The Swift library represents RECON values using the following algebraic data type:

```swift
enum Item {
  case Field(Recon.Field)
  case Value(Recon.Value)
}

enum Field {
  case Attr(String, Value)
  case Slot(Value, Value)
}

enum Value {
  case Record(Recon.Record)
  case Text(String)
  case Data(Recon.Data)
  case Number(Double)
  case Extant
  case Absent
}
```
